  <preparation>Pre-heat griddle over medium heat. Combine dry ingredients in a
  <equipment>mixing bowl</equipment>. Stir in egg, milk and oil. Use a large
  spoon or gravy ladle to transfer pancake batter to the
  <equipment>griddle</equipment>. Pancakes are ready to flip when large
  bubbles can be seen on top.</preparation>

  <serving>Top with fruit and berries or serve with traditional maple
  syrup.</serving>

  <notes>All-purpose flour may be used instead of wheat blend, but decrease
  the milk by 1/4 C and cut the baking powder by 1/2 tsp. You may also replace
  the unrefined sugar with brown sugar and yes, regular eggs work too, but at
  this point you have completely sold out to The Man and may as well just hop
  in your beemer and drive to some trendy, over-priced, yuppie pancake house
  and get it over with.</notes>
